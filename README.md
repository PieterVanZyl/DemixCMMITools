Hi Pat
 
Thank you for your prompt reply.
 
It would be wonderful to join you for a “Show and Tell” time slots and provide a demonstration of the tools, and I will send some slides beforehand.
However, I am busy this week with an appraisal, so this week is not possible. 
Joan and I have agreed that Demix can make the tools available for free to the CMMI community under the MIT License agreement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License
 
One of the primary motivations for making the tools available is that we are finding the new appraisal process excellent. However, it is quite heavy on administration.
Suppose we can reduce the administrative burden, but keep the principle benchmark appraisal process as is. In that case, it is good all-around for everyone.

The new process (with reduced administrative burden) will continually push the industry to provide high-quality appraisal results with fidelity. Something important for all of us CMMI evangelists.
 
Warm regards, Pieter

Pieter,

Thanks for contacting me regarding the new tools Demix has developed.  We are all looking for ways to take some of the pain out of the CAS appraisal planning process!

As I have previously communicated, “Show and Tell” time slots are given to those willing to share their ideas/tools with your fellow lead appraisers provided the person sharing is willing to provide whatever tools you are demonstrating to any lead appraiser who wants it at no cost and with no restrictions on their use.  So if you are willing to essentially give away anything you mention in your talk, I am more than happy to allocate the time.  Assuming that you’re fine with that, please provide the materials (tools and presentation materials about the tools) to me in advance, and I’ll slot you in!

Would you mind if I recorded that portion of the Water Cooler session so that non-attending lead appraisers might also take advantage of your new tools?

Thanks,

Pat

Hi Pat

I trust you are well. May you and your family have a blessed and prosperous 2021.

Demix has developed some support tools which may help to reduce the effort with the planning of the V2.0 appraisals.
Can I have 30 minutes of your time (Zoom) and I can give you a quick demonstration?

You can then tell me if you think the other LAs could benefit from it.

Warm regards, Pieter
